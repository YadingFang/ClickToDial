# Click-to-Dial (CTD) API User Story

| **Item**   | **Details**    |
| ------------------------ | ----------- |
| ***Summary***   | As an application developer belonging to logistics and consulting services, I want to acquire the capability from a Communication Service Provider (CSP) through our enterprise's application server, to allow our corporate clients to initiate dual-call requests to mobiles or landlines via web, app, or CRM systems. This capability should enable a conversation between the two parties after the second call is connected, while ensuring that both the caller and callee's terminals only display the system access code, protecting the privacy of both parties' numbers. This is to ensure that our users can conduct high-quality voice services while their privacy is protected.      |
| ***Roles, Actors and Scope*** | **Roles:** Customer:User <br /> **Actors:** Application service providers, application developers.<br /> **Scope:** <br />*Order To Activate (OTA)* - Create/Remove service instance (CTD session resource), get notification about the instance (CTD session resource) |
| ***Pre-conditions***      | The preconditions are listed below:<br />  <li>Customer:User is eligible to use the CTD API, i.e. the Customer has successfully subscribed to the CTD API on the platform of an API Provider</li> <li>the customer application server has requested and received an access token for the required scopes of the API. Which specific authorization flows are to be used will be determined during onboarding</li> process.     |
| ***Activities/Steps***        | **Starts when:** The customer application server makes a POST request to the CTD API, and optionally registers a callback URL for receiving notification events.  <br />**Ends when:** When the call ends, the activity is deemed complete.           |
| ***Post-conditions***         | If a callback URL is specified, the user will receive CTD status notifications during the call session.  |
