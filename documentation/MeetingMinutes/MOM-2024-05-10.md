## Discussion

* The bi-weekly meeting will be scheduled for Friday afternoons every two weeks and will be strictly adhered to in the future. The meeting link will be the Teams connection on the homepage of the click-to-dial subproject team. The weekly meetings will need to discuss unresolved PRs and issues.

* Firstly, it is clear that all PRs must be discussed in each meeting before they can be merged. After this meeting, the PR with formatting issues mentioned by Herbert needs to be revised and discussed in the next meeting. Only after the discussion and approval can it be merged. The md file format of the Click-to-Dial API user story has significant issues that need to be corrected promptly. The revised version must be discussed in the next meeting.

* Regarding the project timeline, the current plan is to complete the user story, API definition, API YAML code, and other mandatory documents noted in the checklist by September. Additionally, a deliverable version should be identified. The testing of this API should be completed by the end of this year.
